Distributed-Systems-Simulator
=============================

This is a simulator for my distributed systems class that reads in formatted event text data and implements lamport clocks and a mutual exclusion algrithm.

I get the feeling that the codebase could be smaller if I redesigned the whole thing from the ground up. 

Run:
pypy Run_Distributed_Systems_Simulator.py -i in.txt -o out.txt
